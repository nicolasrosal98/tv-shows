            Lord Eddard Stark, ruler of the North, is summoned to court by his
            old friend, King Robert Baratheon, to serve as the King's Hand.
            Eddard reluctantly agrees after learning of a possible threat to the
            King's life. Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow must make a painful
            decision about his own future, while in the distant east Viserys
            Targaryen plots to reclaim his father's throne, usurped by Robert,
            by selling his sister in marriage.
